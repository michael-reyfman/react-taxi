This is a test project done by me, Michael Reyfman in July 2017. It is a rewritten front-end part of my old coursework and it imitates a work of a taxi car park.

[Features]
- Has a registration form for passengers and drivers
- After a passanger makes an order, it is added into driver terminal where it can be accepted by every driver
- Has own userpage for passenger and driver where they can view and complete orders, change their profile etc
- User can undo their order before they are accepted by one of the drivers, they are erased from the terminal
- Driver also can undo their orders, their status are changed from ACCEPTED to WAITING
- Completed orders are erased from the terminal
